This role sits at the intersection of strategy and craft. You'll translate Claude's capabilities into value propositions that land differently for a CFO evaluating AI for financial analysis than for a pharma researcher assessing tools for literature review. You'll build the content foundations — voice, positioning, educational materials — that help enterprises trust AI in high-stakes contexts. And you'll execute across the full journey: thought leadership, sales enablement, product onboarding, and customer success. You'll also use Claude as a core part of how you work — writing, thinking, prototyping — and bring what you learn back into the content you create for customers.",
